# TODO

## Before releasing the first version

- [ ] Implement publishing changed files (the button doesn't do anything yet)
- [ ] Disable Save button after saving
- [x] Show folders as expandable list items (right now the list just displays all files and folders without any tree structure)
- [ ] Handle subdirectories in file list
- [ ] Configure CodeMirror syntax highlighting based on the selected file's extension (right now JavaScript is hardcoded so it's used for every opened file)
- [ ] The app opens a test Dat archive by default, should instead show some info about the app and only show a Dat archive once the user has opened one with the "Open Dat archive" button
