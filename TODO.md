# TODO

## Bugs

- [ ] Make sure Undo (Ctrl+Z) doesn't go back to prior opened files (partially fixed, still goes back one file sometimes due to react CodeMirror component not always being re-created when switching files)

## Future updates

- [ ] Show picture instead of opening it in editor
- [ ] Show video instead of opening it in editor
- [ ] Add a fork button so you can fork read-only archives to edit the files
- [ ] Add diff to see what changed in files, either before publishing or with a new diff button
- [ ] Add revert button to discard all non-published changes
- [ ] Add dark theme
- [ ] Add button that lets the user revert unsaved changes, which would just load the file state from the DatArchive.
- [ ] Add button to save all unsaved files
